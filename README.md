# webapp
Some key points about my first web application :-)

It is essentially a blog website. Some key features that
make it unique from other similar websites is that it has
post upvoting and bookmarking features.

Somehwhat like Reddit, it has a community essence.
Hence I'd say this website is best used when dedicated 
to a very particular subject

Regular functionality like CRUD, login management, profile 
picture management also present.
Database includes many-to-many relationships amd self referencing
tables as well

Techstack and technologies used
-flask and Python 3.8
-HTML, CSS 
-Bootstrap
-Font-Awesome components


Stackoverflow and subreddit r/flask were of great help.
